### Description
  Random Meetup Finder (refereed to as RMF for the rest of this document) is a Ruby command line application. RMF seeds a SQLite3 database with information from Meetup.com's public API. RMF then allows users to view random group suggestions for them to join or skip. Users can browse a list of groups they have joined and view a list of upcoming events that the group is holding. RMF displays the location and date of these events and allows users to RSVP to an event and save the event to a list the user can access later. The meetup and group information RMF handles is persistent, allowing users to exit the application and still retrieve their data upon return.
